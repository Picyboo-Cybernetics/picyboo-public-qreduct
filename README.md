## Overview
Breakthrough: Reducing Data Storage to 10%–20% of Original Size – The Future of Post-Quantum Infrastructure

Classical compression algorithms achieve 60–70% reduction by exploiting statistical patterns; Q-Reduct achieves 80–90% reduction by solving the inverse problem – encoding only the mathematical constraints that uniquely specify the original data, then reconstructing content through constraint satisfaction. Classical reconstruction is intentionally made computationally infeasible; quantum algorithms using Grover search reduce the computational cost from O(2^n) to O(2^(n/2)), making decoding practical on future quantum hardware. This establishes a fundamentally different information-theoretic paradigm where storage density and reconstruction complexity are deliberately decoupled.
